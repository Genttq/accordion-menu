                        The Moon is sometimes visible during the day because of its orbit around the Earth, which
                        positions it above the horizon during daylight hours. It reflects sunlight, making it bright
                        enough to see even against the blue sky. The visibility depends on the lunar phase, particularly
                        during the first and last quarters. The Moon's brightness contrasts with the daytime sky,
                        allowing it to be seen.

                        The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. This occurs because
                        molecules and small particles in the Earth's atmosphere scatter sunlight in all directions.

                        The question of whether we will ever discover aliens is both intriguing and complex, involving
                        numerous scientific, technological, and philosophical considerations. While it's impossible to
                        predict the future with certainty, several factors influence the likelihood of discovering
                        extraterrestrial life.

                        The Earth weighs approximately 5,970,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilograms. This immense mass is
                        determined through gravitational calculations, observations of orbital mechanics, and
                        experiments like the Cavendish experiment. The Earth's mass is essential for understanding
                        gravitational forces and interactions with other celestial bodies. Its weight reflects the
                        planet's size and density.

                    <span class="accordion-title">How do airplanes stay up?</span>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>
                        Airplanes stay up due to the balance of four main forces. Lift, created by the wing shape,
                        counteracts weight. Thrust from the engines propels the airplane forward, enabling lift. Drag
                        opposes this motion, and control surfaces help pilots manage direction and stability. By
                        balancing lift, weight, thrust, and drag, airplanes achieve and maintain flight.
